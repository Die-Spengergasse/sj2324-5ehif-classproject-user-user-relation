"In a realm where recipes blend,
The CookBook app, our dearest friend.
With a swipe, a tap, a gentle look,
We dive deep into the culinary book.

From pastas, pies, to a zesty stew,
Incredible dishes, old and new.
It guides our hands, our pots, our pans,
Crafting feasts that meet all plans.

Its interface sleek, so clear and neat,
Finding recipes becomes a treat.
Each meal displayed, a work of art,
A symphony of taste, a culinary chart.

Oh CookBook app, so vast, so grand,
You hold the world in your digital hand.
In our kitchens, you're the shining star,
With you, we'll cook, no matter how far.""

-Ghandi
